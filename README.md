## Overview

A new challenge as part of my exercises to master HTML and CSS.

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Especially on the desktop, layout was a challenge, but with the help of Grid and Flexbox, I succeeded!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- Combining Grid and Flexbox to layout the page
- Using `justify-content` and `align-items` for centering the items.

### Continued development

Since I learned a lot on this project, I'm looking forward to trying more challenges from Frontend Mentor.
